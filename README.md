# 🕷️ Python Web Scraper

**Data Extraction · Automation · Structured Outputs**

This project is a **modular Python web scraping system** designed to reliably extract, normalize, and export data from web sources for downstream analytics, reporting, or automation workflows.

Built with old-school discipline (*respect the web, don’t break things*) and modern tooling, this scraper demonstrates how to turn unstructured web content into **clean, decision-ready datasets**.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

This scraper is designed to answer one simple business question:

> **How do we turn public web data into usable information—consistently and responsibly?**

### Primary Goals
- Automate data collection from web pages  
- Parse and structure messy HTML into clean datasets  
- Export data in analytics-friendly formats  
- Handle failures gracefully (timeouts, retries, blocks)  
- Remain extensible for future targets and pipelines

## 🧠 Key Features

### HTTP-Based Scraping
- Uses `requests` with realistic headers  
- Avoids unnecessary browser overhead when possible  

### HTML Parsing
- Robust DOM parsing with **BeautifulSoup**  
- Selector-based extraction for maintainability  

### Structured Output
- Exports to **CSV** and **JSON**  
- DataFrames ready for **BI**, **ML**, or **dashboards**  

### Reliability Built In
- Retry logic with exponential backoff  
- Timeouts and error handling  
- Polite request pacing
